## UX

The F&G website is a place for new homeowners and residents of many years to come and gain inspiration for future projects and to collaborate with the F&G team, the site is stripped back in colour and layout providing a simple yet effective structure and allowing users to focus on the design elements that are shown and providing a streamlined user journey leading them to the contact page which allows them to engage with the F&G team directly where they can specify and tailor their needs.

* As a new user I want to be able to quickly gain inspiration from strong visuals and see a representation of previous works and gather more information regarding services provided so that I can determine if F&G meets my personal needs
